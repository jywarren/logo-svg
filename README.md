#Logo-SVG

A minimal Logo command set for SVG.js:

* FORWARD/FW
* BACKWARD
* LEFT/LT
* RIGHT/RT
* RESET
* SETX, SETY, SETXY
* HOME
* CLEARSCREEN/CLEAR/CS
* REPEAT

Maybe:

* TO FOO :ARG1 :ARG2 BODY END

Demo at https://jywarren.github.io/logo-svg

Inspired by the `canvas`-based version at https://github.com/rmmh/papert

But intended for lasercutting use, so SVG was needed!

Quite messy, not as generalizable as I'd like, so please chip in!
